# The Kitchen’s Nether Beacon Mod [Fabric]

## This Mod is in Beta

I am showcasing some of the features in a beta version so that I can respond to community feedback for the first release.  If you download the mod right now, you will be able to experiment with a proof-of-concept nether beacon that still has a few bugs and lacks all the features detailed below.

## Introduction

Ever wanted to keep pesky mobs & players at bay and have a beacon all to yourself?  Now you can with the The Kitchen’s Nether Beacon mod!  This mod allows you to craft a new type of configurable beacon that draws upon the dark energy of the nether.

## A Personal Beacon

There are two types of beacons: 1) the guardian and 2) the conqueror.

#### The Guardian

The guardian nether beacon can be crafted using a nether beacon base and a netherite shield fragment (found in bastion remnants).  It will allow you to apply buffs to all friendly mobs and players (yes, it can stop applying effects to a player if they begin attacking you) in the area.  For example, you can provide regeneration, saturation, slow falling, invisibility, or levitation (or any other effect you add to the config file) to all mobs in the vicinity.  This beacon can work well at large bases or in villages.  The guardian nether beacon will also repair any netherite gear carried by players in the vicinity.

#### The Conqueror

The conqueror nether beacon can be crafted using a nether beacon base and a netherite blade fragment (found in bastion remnants).  It will allow you to apply buffs to all other mobs and players in the area, regardless of whether they are hostile or not.  For example, you can apply mining fatigue, slowness, withering, or blindness effects any mobs or players nearby.  You can also use the nether beacon to gain the soulbound effect, which boosts your damage and armor stats using nether energy.  The conqueror nether beacon can also be used to highlight, slow down, or wither away hostile mobs in the area.
